                your survey more interesting by incorporating interesting
                format, funny images, and graphics into the survey layout.

                positive and negative experiences. Responses from such genuine
                customers are easier to come by. However, the majority of
                customers are unwilling to share their thoughts. You can
                motivate the second type of customer to provide feedback by
                offering an incentive.

                information can be obtained by incorporating a customer feedback
                tool in the form of a popup throughout your website. It is the
                most effective way to obtain immediate feedback from customers.

                website experience. You can also ask open-ended questions to
