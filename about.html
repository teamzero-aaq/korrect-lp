          Hi there :)
          <br /><br style="line-height: 30px" />
          We’r co-founders of Korrect.<br /><br style="line-height: 30px" />
          If you have got a couple of minutes we would like to share unlikely
          story of how Korrect was born. It all started back in 2016. Back then
          we were a product studio called Kustard based out of Mumbai India.
          Companies hired us to build their software products from scratch &
          simplify their business.<br /><br style="line-height: 30px" />
          Business was great and we were extremely busy. We were shipping
          products for our clients like macDonald’s burgers, fast efficient and
          our client’s were saying "We are loving it!". We used to ship first
          version of the client’s products within 8-10 weeks and then used to
          work on the product iteratively based on the feedback received from
          their customers. With so many concurrent projects, things began to
          slip through the cracks.<br /><br style="line-height: 30px" />
          Projects dragged too long, we dropped the ball on key feedback due to
          in-efficient process in processing feedback. We had some major
          miscommunication problems (“Wait, who said that? What needs to be
          added? When? Where?”).<br /><br style="line-height: 30px" />
          Back then, we relied on excel sheets, trello boards, notion pages,
          notes. All of these tools are great of many things. But they are not
          great for capturing, analysing & processing the feedback on the
          products you deliver to your customers. it was very difficult to act
          upon it given the thousands of entries and the lack of context. We
          didn’t know how important every feedback or feature request was, who
          will it impact, how will it impact, how many people will it affect, it
          was a huge pain to prioritise and figure out the what to build next
          (in-fact what not to build next) as it’s practically not possible to
          ship all the feature requests or act upon all the feedback. You gotta
          filter out signal out of all the noise. Things get lost, people get
          left out of conversations, there’s nowhere to go to see what’s left to
          do & what to pick up for next sprint build. Know what I mean?
          <br /><br style="line-height: 30px" />
          So we started looking for a product feedback management tool. We
          needed something to capture what our client’s customers are saying
          after using the product, communicate ideas with client’s team
          internally, organise the work to be done based on the feedback
          received, present the product roadmap to client and it’s customers &
          inform them once it’s live as simple as that.<br /><br
            style="line-height: 30px"
          />
          We tried a few tools, but they were complicated and too hard to use.
          So we slowly slipped back to using our old standby - excel sheets and
          notion. Our problems continued. Meanwhile our business was running
          great and profitable from day 1 of it’s inception. We had grown from
          just 3 founders to an extremely talented team of 20 ninja’s. In 2020
          October one of our client gave us an offer to sell the business at
          $2M, the offer was great and we had a comfort of working with the
          client’s team so we decided to take it. While building on the projects
          after getting acquired we found ourselves in the same spot of managing
          feedback in-efficiently. <br /><br style="line-height: 30px" />
          Frustrated, we decided to build our own simple product feedback
          management tool specially crafted for product teams who are working on
          scale and listening to multiple channels of feedback. We also
          discovered that being transparent with your users and customers earns
          you customer loyalty so we ended up building stuff where you can build
          and maintain a public roadmap along with internal roadmaps and
          whenever you release any feature or enhancements, it gets pushed to a
          change log which is also public.<br /><br style="line-height: 30px" />
          We at Korrect, are extremely obsessed about building great software.
          Always keeping users at the centre of everything we do. We are on a
          mission to help teams build better products with our wide range of
          solutions catering to a gamete of use-cases. More importantly, we are
          bootstrapped which ensures we always build stuff that our users
          actually want and we are here to stay! Our job is to help you your job
          better.<br /><br style="line-height: 30px" />
          We hope you’ll consider using Korrect to grease the wheels of your
          products. Everything runs efficient with Korrect behind the scenes!
          <br /><br style="line-height: 30px" />
          Here’s to never compromising and building great products, making
          things happen for you every day!
